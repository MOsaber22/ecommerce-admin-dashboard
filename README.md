# 🛒 E-Commerce Admin Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple E-Commerce Admin Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

It allows the admin to manage products through full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
All data is stored using the browser's Local Storage to maintain persistence after page refresh.
